#+title: denote-completing-format
#+author: Luis Garc√≠a

This small extension introduces =denote-completing-format-open-or-create= and =denote-completing-format-link-or-create= commands, an alterantive to =denote-open-or-create= and =denote-link-or-create= that align and fontify the elements of denote file names in completing-read prompt. (Note that this command does not perform well at large scale. See [[file:README.org::Laggs when working with lots of notes][Laggs when working with lots of notes]]).

** Installation and configuration

Clone this repository:

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/b3m3bi/denote-completing-format
#+end_src

Require and configure package on =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "./denote-completing-format") ; path to repo
  (require 'denote-completing-format)
  (global-key (kbd "C-n n f") #'denote-completing-format-open-or-create)
  (global-key (kbd "C-n n i") #'denote-completing-format-link-or-create)
#+end_src

** Configuration

You can configure the container sizes of different denote's file name elements with the variables: =denote-completing-format-subdir-width=, =denote-completing-format-date-width=, =denote-completing-format-title-width=, =denote-completing-format-keywords-width= and =denote-competing-format-extension-width=.

Aditionally you can deslugiffy file title with =denote-completing-format-desslugiffy=, and customize the fonts by modifing the =denote-completing-format-fonts-= variables. Also you can change the function to create notes with =denote-completing-format-create-function=.

** Laggs when working with lots of notes

The creation of the formatted completion table is inefficient and slow which implies long delays to prompt for file selection. In a test folder containing 13000 notes ([[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/testing-denote-package/][created using Peter Prevos script]]) the execution time of the creation of the formatted completion table (=denote-completing-format-open-or-create=) is greater than 2.7 seconds ( =benchmark-run=). In contrast the file prompt used by =denote-open-or-create= (=denote-file-prompt=) takes approximatly 0.4 seconds.

** TODOS

+ build the completion prompt in a more eficient and fast way
+ customize prompt formatting using a template instead of customizing multiple individual variables (similar to [[https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar#templates][citar's template]])
+ implement completing-read best practices (e.g., add category metadata to completing candidates)
